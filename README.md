# Optimizing Research Software Codes Project

The Optimizing Research Software Codes project aims to improve the performance of an existing research tool used for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data analysis.  
Specifically, the inherited RINEX2DB Python program converts RINEX observation and navigation files into `.csv` outputs. Our goal is to reduce computation time while maintaining accuracy.
